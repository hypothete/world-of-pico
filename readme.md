# World of Pico

World of Pico uses the PICO-8 GPIO pins to transfer map data to the client from a Javascript source. This lets servers provide linked maps to the player, essentially allowing for unlimited map size for a PICO-8 game.

## Roadmap

- menu system
- toolbar
- create new maps
- place tiles
- resize maps
- colorize maps
- use neighbors to figure out more complex map rendering (corners etc)
- add objects
